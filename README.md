This is a slightly modified version of the excellent stargazer package by Marek Hlavac (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/vignettes/stargazer.pdf). In contrast to the main package, this fork outputs tables which use the booktabs commands \toprule \midrule and \bottomrrule for horizontal rules and \cmidrule for shorter lines. See https://github.com/markwestcott34/stargazer-booktabs/blob/master/vignettes/stargazer-booktabs.pdf for example output.
